# Flutter Firebase CRUD Application
Flutter Project
This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using Flutter and Firebase. The application allows you to manage employee data by creating, reading, updating, and deleting employee records in a Firebase Realtime Database.

# Features
* Create: Add new employee records to the Firebase database.
* Read: Retrieve and display existing employee records from the Firebase database.
* Update: Modify existing employee records in the Firebase database.
* Delete: Remove employee records from the Firebase database.

# Setup Instructions
Flutter Installation: Ensure that you have Flutter installed on your development machine. You can follow the instructions on the official Flutter website for installation.

# Firebase Setup:
* Create a new Firebase project on the Firebase Console.
* Add a new Firebase Realtime Database to your project.
* Configure Firebase authentication (if needed) and make sure your security rules allow read and write access to your database.
* Copy your Firebase project configuration (google-services.json for Android or GoogleService-Info.plist for iOS) into your Flutter  project under the appropriate directory.

# Flutter Dependencies:
Ensure that you have added the necessary dependencies for Firebase and Flutter in your pubspec.yaml file. You'll typically need packages like firebase_core, firebase_database, and firebase_auth.

# Code Integration:
Integrate Firebase initialization code in your Flutter application. This usually involves initializing Firebase in your main.dart file.
Implement CRUD operations using Firebase Database API in your Flutter application.

# Usage
* Running the Application:
Connect your development device or emulator.
Run the Flutter application using the flutter run command.
* Creating Records:
Use the application interface to add new employee records. Provide necessary details such as employee name, ID, etc., and save the record to Firebase.
* Reading Records:
View existing employee records fetched from the Firebase database. The application should display a list of employees with their details.
* Updating Records:
Select a specific employee record from the list and choose the update option. Modify the employee details and save the changes to Firebase.
* Deleting Records:
Choose a specific employee record to delete and confirm the deletion. The application should remove the selected employee record from the Firebase database.
